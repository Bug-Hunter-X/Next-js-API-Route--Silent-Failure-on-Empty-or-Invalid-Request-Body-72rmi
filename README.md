# Next.js API Route: Silent Failure on Empty or Invalid Request Body

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in Next.js 15 API routes.  When the request body is empty or improperly parsed (often due to a missing or incorrect `Content-Type` header), accessing `req.body` can cause the route to fail silently, without a clear error message.

## Problem
The provided `pages/api/hello.js` file attempts to access `req.body`. If the request doesn't include a body, or if the `Content-Type` header is missing or incorrect, this will lead to an unhandled error, resulting in a silent failure.  The server might return a 500 error without a helpful message, making debugging difficult.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  It explicitly checks if `req.body` exists before accessing it.  Adding more robust error handling prevents silent failures and provides more informative error messages to the client.
